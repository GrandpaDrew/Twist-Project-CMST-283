# TWIST final Project

This Github repository will contain all of the files necessary to build/run the TWIST website including both the database and the user interface.

this was a project that I wish I could have helped with more. I was not very fortunate with my VS CODE app and I was unable to contribute as much as I would of liked to
that being said, I was able to contribute a sizeable portion of the original HTML (pre-pug conversion) and I worked on the design of the logo aswell.
The Purpose of this site is to allow teen women who may be interested in sciences the opportunity to attend sessions with professionals in the field of science 
that they are interested in. The site allows for many options in what type of science the applicant is interested in allowing for exposure to sciences that the 
applicants may be unaware of. The sites purpose is also to allow for the administrators of TWIST to set and schedule events and edit sessions of the applicants 
on a admin specific page. The site is robust in its features by offering multiple webpages, each of which do different operations. The home page is a portal that 
displays when the next upcoming event will transpire, as well as, it gives a detailed description of what the twist project is and who it is for. 
The register page allows applicants to submit forms of personal information followed by their interests and in what fields of sciences they intend on learning about. 
The administration page links to a log in, which when successful log in with username and password is verified the administrator has the ability to view upcoming 
sessions, admins can assign sessions to applicants and can edit applicantsâ€™ sessions if needed. 
I worked with Bailey, Bryce, and Garrett on the front end team.
